How to Play - You are attacked by several rows of bullet firing aliens. The aliens move from side to side and 
appoach you each time they reach a side.Your goal is to blast all of the aliens before they blast you and/or reach the bottom.
You are giving three lives to achieve ths goal.



Explanations of specific Technologies - HTML, CSS and JavaScript were used to make this project. 
The window object and canvas element were of particular importance for setting up and isloating the game play. Using the canvas element allowed me 
to change the background to a real space image. I also changed the body tag on the main html by using CSS, but I purposely used a GIF image 
to give it a wow factor.

Approach Taken - My approach was study the programming logic of the game. I did this by parsing the 
code of three different versions of the game provided by YouTubers. I particulary liked the version created by
the user "Budggy Dev". I forked his code and began to make customizations. I decreased the FPS on the blast. I changed the bullet color.
I added sound effects for the tank shot and for the alien explosion. I changed the color for the text on opening and closing screens.

Unsolved Problems- The side to side movment seems to be shorter as the game advances. The tank blast and alien blast sound is the same.
I have a tank blast wav loaded and declared in the global variables. I just couldn't find the location to call the sound.play function.

Things that I would improve include adding a flying saucer going across the top of the screen for extra points. Adding barriers for the tank. Could not find background music that plays continuously on the real game.
