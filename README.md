Explanations of specific Technologies - HTML, CSS and JavaScript were used to make this project. 
The Canvas element was of particular importance for isloating the game play. Using the canvas element allowed me 
to change the background to a real space image. I also changed the body tag on the main html by using CSS, but I purposely using a JPEG image 
to give it a wow factor.

Approach Taken - My approach was study the programming logic of the game. I did this by parsing the 
code of three different versions of the game provided by YouTubers. I particulary liked the version created by
the user "Budggy Dev". I forked his code and began to make customizations. I decreased the FPS on the blast. I changed the bullet color.
I added sound effects for the tank shot and for the alien explosion. I changed the color for the text on opening and closing screens.

Unsolved Problems- adding a flying saucer to the top of the screen for extra points. Adding barriers for the tank. Could not find background music
that plays continuously on the real game.
